Clustering
******************************************************************************

In Stage1, we used an idea came up with ourselves. We created a similarities matrix which indicate similarities between
each instance pair. Both x and y axises are instances. Then for each instance, pick one instance which has the most shared
word with it. These 2 instances form a small cluster and then the program merges small clusters into larger clusters. This
approach has a flaw that there will be many small clusters with only 2 instances in them. This is becuase when the program
merges smaller clusters there is a chance that some small cluster won't get merged if A is best match of B and B is the best
match of A. Then A and B will form a closed cycle. In the case of A and B is best match and B and C is the best match, then
A, B and C will form a new cluster.

In Stage 2, we used an idea from the paper "Automatic Word Sense Discrimination". We present words and contexts as vector
and store these vectors in vector space. Then use hierarchical clustering approach to cluster them. This clustering approach
is obviously better than our clustering approach in Stage 1.

To summarize, both Stage 1 and Stage 2 discriminate word sense based on context similarities. But in Stage 2, we use vectors
to present word and contexts. And in Stage 2, we use hierarchical clustering approach which is better than the approach used
in Stage 1. In Stage 1, our program will generate too many clusters compare with input. But in Stage 2, the number of clusters
generated by our program is more reasonable and the instances are clustered more accurately.

DefinitionGeneration
***********************************************************************************
In Baseline system, for DefinitionGeneration:

We relied on shared words to get definition - We took a list of all words shared by atleast two instances in each cluster
and found the top5 words most repeated words for each cluster and used those 5 words as definition.

Our new approach is based on the collocation property -> sense of a target word is dependent on the neighboring words
We identified the position of target word in the context and took 5 neighbouring words to the left and 5 to the right.
likewise, we collected collocated words for target word from all instances in a cluster.
Then we took the top2 most repeated collocated words and formed a complete sentence using those 2 words.
the complete sentence is used as definition for the cluster.

->Our idea was to use POS tags for these two words and then form sentences using POS tags. But we were not always successful
in NLTK installation, so we decided against it.

Improvements over baseline:
    1. Using collocated words: we used shared words in baseline-> the definition usually do not depend on a word that exists
    at a long distance. By using collocated words, we get the sense of the target word more often than not.
    2. Using complete sentence in definition generation - clearly more understandable

Results:
    sense id: 4
    definition: refers to name of an entity, place or quality similar to  felony AND/OR counts
    example:
    Tuesday with murder for allegedly stabbing her brother’s girlfriend to death with a pair of scissors during an 
    argument in Rowland Heights over the weekend. Lisette Kimberly Moreno was <head>charged</head> with one count 
    of murder and a special allegation that she personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon during the commission 
    of the crime, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office stated in a news release. Moreno allegedly got 
    into an argument with 21-year-old Annette Martinez on Aug. 6 at an apartment in the 1900 block of Baston Avenue,
     the release stated.
     
     The definition is this example gives us a sense of the target word- charged.
     
**************************************************************************************************************************
Example Generation
**************************************************************************************************************************

  The baseline approach is based on selecting a random instance from all the instances.
  Our new aproach is based on "Text Summarization using Text Rank Approch". It has been outlined in the paper : http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P04-3020

Improvement on base-line:

Step 1:
  Firstly, the data is preprocessed and all the punctuations and stop-words are removed. This becomes the input for the example generation part.

Step 2:
  According to this method, we follow a graph-based approch to address the problem of selecting a best example.
  In this approach each instance is represented as a vertex and a similarity coefficient is associated for every pair of vertices. For this we have used a two-dimensional matrix to represnt the instances.
  The similarity coefficient is calculated based on the lexical similarity between the two instances i.e the number of common words between every pair of instances.
      
         Similarity(Si,Sj)=(|Wk|Wk belongs to both Si and Sj)/log(|Si|)+log(|Sj|)
    here 
        
          >>Si    - represents sentence i.
          >>Sj    - represents sentence j.
          >>Wk    - represents work k.
          >>|Si|  - reprents length of Si
          >>|Sj|  - represents length of Sj
          
  This similarity coefficient represents the edge weight between every pair of indices in the graph.
  
Step 3:
  After calculating the similarity coefficient, the next step is to assign a similairty weight for every vertex in the graph that has been constructed.
  This is done by summing the similarity coefficients for the current vertex with every other vertex. This becomes the similarity weight for the vertex. In this manner, we compute similarity weights for every vertex in the graph.
  We finally select a vertex with the maximum similarity weight.
  
#Initially, we thought of implementing stemming before calculating the similarity coefficients. However, due to issues with NLTK, we did not accomplish that part.
#Another idea we had was to add frequency_score which is the count of the frequency of the thematic words in the given instance to the similarity weight. But we had some issues which we could not fix.
  
 Example:
     sense id: 2
     definition: refers to the property or quality similar to  juice AND/OR water
     example:
     <head>orange</head> juice helps improve blood circulation, avoiding the formation of clots, and therefore can prevent arteriosclerosis.
 
 The example best illustrates the sense.

Discussion of results:
*****************************************************************************************************************************
With a F-measure score of 73, clearly "orange" is our best case and 'commit' is our worst case with 34 F-measure score.


We are using space vecotors based on shared words for sense clustering.
In the orange data, it has two senses -> fruit or county/place
and usually, instances of different senses did not share many words making it easy to segregate into clusters.

Also in the definition generation,
we are considering collocated words. and in the data, orange is usually surrounded by juice, fruit, vitamin or county, mayor
and hence we are getting senses as good as the below ones.

sense id: 1
definition: refers to an action similar to  county AND/OR california
example:
<head>orange</head> will continue to expand to the east, where it has a 60-square mile sphere of influence extending to the county line. Preliminary plans call for a variety of developments in the area around Irvine Lake, with much of the area to the north of the lake remaining as open space.

sense id: 2
definition: refers to the property or quality similar to  juice AND/OR water
example:
<head>orange</head> juice helps improve blood circulation, avoiding the formation of clots, and therefore can prevent arteriosclerosis..

Owing to the similar reasons, for commit, instances of different senses share too many commmon words and hence we did not get really good
clusters.
