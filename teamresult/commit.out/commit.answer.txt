run by the author, who is a local education authority (LEA) special education adviser. He reports on the feedback from the members of the course: Teachers seem to appreciate an attempt to be positive about the Education Reform Act. So much of what has been written is of the doom and gloom variety. (Bailey 1989: 82) His stance is as much an attempt to influence the outcomes as it is a prediction of the likely consequences of the Act. If teachers believe that the National Curriculum can widen curriculum opportunities for all, and <head>commit</head> themselves to this cause, then it may turn out to be so. Much of the writing that followed the Act has borne this' make the best of it' message, alongside attempts to muster the collective will to the task ahead: Before resigning ourselves to permanent depression and a feeling that special needs have slipped from the political agenda, it may be useful to look again at some of the implications for change for the better...

This experience had such a dramatic effect on the Pole that he hanged himself some days later. No further reports have been documented, but possibly people who have seen a replay of the awful scene wish to remain silent not wishing to discuss the macabre subject. In the 1920s a local man was in a terrible state of nerves and he too visited the bridge with the one thought in his mind. Yes, he did <head>commit</head> suicide on that bridge but he drank from a bottle of lysol which would mean a swift but painful end. I wonder if he is seen too? # THE HIGH WYCOMBE FOOTSTEPS # A recent story, quite unexplained, was related to me by Mr G. Leslie who is employed by British Rail in the London area. This story concerns the sounds of footsteps walking in the ballast; no one was seen but the sounds were very convincing and one respects the account of this mystery from Mr Leslie,

proof of fault, at least at the level of subjective recklessness? Further offences of endangerment may be found in the Firearms Act 1968. Section 16 contains an offence of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, which corresponds to the offence under section 3 of the Explosives Act. Again, the circumstances of the possession are likely to raise an inference of intent, unless the possession was clearly connected with some authorised shooting activity. There are then three possession offences of a slightly different type. Section 18 penalizes the possession of a firearm with intent to <head>commit</head> a crime or to resist arrest: this is a more specific variation of section 16, catering for the defence that the firearm was being carried for use in a robbery but with no intention that it would actually be used to endanger anyone, only to frighten -- that would be a section 18 offence. Section 19 penalises possession of a loaded firearm in a public place, presumably in circumstances where the section 16 offence can not be proved, but on the argument that the mere possession is sufficiently dangerou

the right to self-determination is to have any meaning for those who are weak or bedridden (e.g. responding to a request to bring pills), but not all are like this. In McShane (1977) a woman was convicted of an attempt to counsel her mother's suicide by repeatedly encouraging her to take an overdose, and it was shown that the mother's death would greatly alleviate the defendant's financial problems. It is for cases of this kind, where the evidence shows that there was active persuasion rather than compassionate assistance to someone already determined to <head>commit</head> suicide, that a substantial maximum penalty is thought necessary. For this offence and for the proposed suicide-pact offence, the Criminal Law Revision committee (CLRC) recommended a maximum of seven years' imprisonment. This grading of the offences may be seen as a compromise between the compassionate elements in the offences, which are related to the right to self-determination, and the need to protect the vulnerable from persuasion on such a crucial matter as the ending of life, an argument also derived from the right to self-determination

Thai saw-mill operators were also turning to loggers in Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia to replace their lost supplies.

On the particular afternoon he decided to end his life he had been watching the marshalling of the fish vans from his office window.

It amazed her that she'd ever believed herself in love with him, that she'd deluded herself into seeing his arrogance and his egotism as positive qualities. That she should have wasted time crying over him was not just amazing, it was incredible.

Nevertheless, the move has been generally welcomed by companies in Scotland involved in the European market. In recent months the deepening troubles of Eastern Europe have been pushed to the edge of the world's stage by the Gulf crisis.

If the price of crude oil remains high and volatile then this will impose severe strains on economies which are already under pressure. In these circumstances it is not surprising that businessmen are hesitant to <head>commit</head> resources to forge new relationships in Eastern Europe. Of course, Western Europe is providing financial and technical help and opportunities exist for experienced exporters, but a realistic, long-term view is essential.

(b) Contract Where the arrangement is agreed between the parties, the practitioner must consider whether or not it is desirable to have a binding contract. If the husband is purchasing a house for himself with the proceeds of sale of his interest in the matrimonial home, then, as he will have to <head>commit</head> himself to a contract in respect of his purchase, it is suggested that there should be a contract relating to the sale of his interest in the matrimonial home so that he is fully safeguarded. This should ensure an adherence to a timetable which otherwise might be lacking in the case of an agreement between the parties not supported by a binding contract.

Early in marriage a re-ordering of priorities is necessary, and some couples can run into trouble if their commitment to, or dependence upon, healthy robust parents can not be allowed to take second place to their commitment to their new partner. But it is unwise to assume that parents will inevitably pose a problem when they are placed first. Some marriages are based on a tacit, if not explicit, agreement that parents have prior claims. Some people marry into families rather than <head>commit</head> themselves to a partner. Later in marriage a particularly keen sense of commitment may be felt towards aged or ailing parents. Obviously there is less conflict if the commitment is shared by both partners, but it can become a source of tension and disagreement. Parents are not the only people to be relegated when couples are establishing a joint identity.

the experiences will be more powerful if they relate directly to children's current theories, and offer them the opportunity to test them and consider alternative accounts. # (5) CREATING AN APPROPRIATE CLASSROOM CLIMATE # The techniques for eliciting and extending children's ideas which I have described will not be entirely successful unless the teacher adopts a role which is supportive and non-threatening. Children are often reluctant to express their ideas for fear of being wrong. The climate in the classroom must be one where children feel that their ideas are valued so that they are willing to <head>commit</head> themselves in public. We have found that creating this climate involves a number of factors. Teachers need to take children's ideas seriously, and avoid making them feel that they have to search for the right answer, hidden somewhere in the teacher's head. Open questions might start with phrases such as: What do you think...? Can you explain why you think that...? Can you tell me about...? This does not mean that children are led to believe they are always right.

In addition, the conglomerate label that Pearson proudly wears does not at present find particular favour with institutional investors. By contrast, Reed's image of a group devoted to publishing/information is appealing. There is also the practical point that an investor wishing to share in the fortunes of say, the oil service industry is better off buying Schlumberger straight than Pearson, which is seen to have all that publishing clutter. And a fund wishing to <head>commit</head> money to the international media industry has in Reed/Elsevier an obvious candidate for such an investment.
