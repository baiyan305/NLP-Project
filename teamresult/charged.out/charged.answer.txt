Turns out, it wasn&#8217;t the fault of either driver when two trucks plunged from I-285 to Ga. 400, causing a crash that stopped traffic at the busy interchange for five hours, police said Thursday. Instead, it was the driver of a 2014 Kia Sorento who allegedly sparked the wreck when he left his lane, driving into the path of a tractor-trailer, according to Sandy Springs police. Howard Silverstein, 64, was <head>charged</head> with failure to maintain lane in the Friday crash. &#8220;Silverstein entered into the path and lane on 285 eastbound already occupied by the Publix tractor-trailer,&#8221; Sandy Springs police said in an emailed statement. &#8220;The right front tire of the Kia Sorento struck the left front tire and rim of the tractor-trailer causing the Kia&#8217;s tire to go flat.&#8221;

"Each of the child care facilities <head>charged</head> have been involved in a common theme of billing the government for child care services and then not providing them. These centers do provide legitimate support and services, but they also bill the government anywhere from 15-30 percent for kids who weren't there," said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman.

adjusted at local levels to reflect national possibilities. For governments, logic would suggest a simple sequence of thought and action. Starting from a recognition of the constraints and opportunities set by human and natural resource endowments, one might assume that they then define a broad set of goals for the future. These set the sights of ambition, often embodied in a series of national plans, what we called national intent in chapter 1. These goals form the basis of both macro-level policies for industry. National institutions and agencies, each responsible for one agenda, are <head>charged</head> with administering specific policies for each sector and each group of multi-nationals. Trouble arises at this point, for no country can ensure that all its ministries and agencies manage everything in a wholly co-ordinated way. There are dilemmas at every level of concern; different interest groups hold different priorities. Thus it is common for policies to be announced but not implemented fully or consistently. Where a country espouses outward-looking policies, it may continue to behave in many important respects as though it were still domestically focused. Dilemma

The Old Trafford side lost out in a dramatic penalty shoot-out with Torpedo Moscow when Steve Bruce, Brian McClair and Gary Pallister all failed from the spot. But bitter Ferguson refused to blame individuals for United's continental calamity and said:' We let them in the back door and they stole the game. 'England defender Pallister was <head>charged</head> with keeping United alive, against a dour Moscow side, once the shoot-out went to sudden death. He found the nerve-racking task too much. Ferguson admitted, 'Even when Paul Ince and Denis Irwin had scored to put us 2-0 ahead, I still wasn't counting my chickens.' In fact, when the match moved into the shoot-out, I didn't really fancy our chances.

The rising gutter literature', as the private press was called, appealed especially to wayward youth. In this connection the whole of the local Komsomol press was ordered to put itself under the leadership of the party guberniia committees. In view of the unorthodox behaviour of the Komsomol that we have noted in the provinces, such a move was overdue. Finally, guberniia executive committees were <head>charged</head> with the resurrection of village reading-rooms, most of which had gone under in the changed economic conditions of NEP. Mere words could do little in the short term to reverse the chaotic situation. Saratov guberniia, admittedly a troubled area, reduced its press network from twenty-five organs in mid-1921 to two by the spring of 1922. Petrograd, still the cultural centre of the whole country, had been spared the cut-back of January 1922, but due to financial pressures four papers merged into two in order to save

may be transferred, and binding promises may be made to an infant, but in general he is unable to make a binding disposition of his property or to make binding promises to others. As regards property, it should be noticed that law and practice, to a large extent, make it unlikely that property of any considerable value will come into the direct ownership of an infant. When property passes on death, it will go in the first instance to the executor appointed by will, or the administrator appointed by the court, who are <head>charged</head> with the duty of dealing with it and transferring it to the persons entitled (see p. 114). Similarly, under the settlements which people of property commonly make, the property will be in the hands of trustees. The infant can not give a receipt which executors, administrators or trustees can safely take. They must therefore retain the property to which an infant is entitled till he attains full age, and meanwhile deal with it under the directions of the will or settlement or under the orders

If you want to change any details of your booking (e.g. transfer to a different holiday, departure date or airport), we will do our best to help. We charge an Amendment Fee of 12 per person named on the booking for each detail of the booking changed. However, if within 6 weeks of departure you change your booking to a later date, the cancellation charges will apply as shown in paragraph 4 unless the new holiday departs on or before the original departure date, when the normal fee of 12 per person will be <head>charged</head>. Where the price varies depending on the number of persons booked into the accommodation and you wish to change that number of persons, the price will be restored on the basis of the new party size as shown in the price panel. Any increase in price per person payable as a result of a part cancellation is not a Cancellation Charge and so is not covered by Norwich Union Insurance. A separate Cancellation Charge will be levied in respect of bookings cancelled in accordance with paragraph 4.

Possibly one of the most dramatic implications is the effect of the two different systems on health (care) planning. Type I systems, because they allocate funds to a health authority, which is <head>charged</head> with responsibility for the health (care) of its (geographically defined) population, will not only ensure, but will require, an important planning role for the health authority, to ensure that local needs and priorities are pursued. However, the Type I system is not without problems. As discussed below, the problems of letting contracts, controlling payments and maintaining quality would be immense in the more radical proposals.

This of course is a value judgement which a government is entitled to make, but it is one which some economists would argue is not fully justified by the evidence, on the basis of which there have been calls for much more stringent control. The main arguments for a tightening up of merger policy, along with suggestions as to how this could be achieved, are considered by George (1989). One suggestion that is favoured by a number of commentators would be to alter the onus of proof. At present the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is <head>charged</head> with determining whether a proposed merger is contrary to the public interest. This means that many mergers for which there have been no demonstrable advantages, but which have not been found to be overtly anti-competitive, have been allowed through, and thus contributed to the general increase in industrial concentration. This consequence of existing policy is particularly important in periods of high merger activity when there is a bandwagon effect with more and more firms seeking to engage in takeover activity.

If we assume that the customer has paid for the goods then the first entries would have been to increase the bank by 600 and include in the profit and 1088 account sales of 600.

We can now examine what should happen in the alternative situations outlined above. In this case we need to reduce the bank by 100 and reduce the profit and loss by 100. Whether the latter is put through as a reduction in sales or a rebate should be discussed in terms of the effects of these alternatives on the usefulness of the profit and loss account as a guide to the future.

Audit is an ex post event and improvements in this important function may be of little long-term value if they are not coupled with more general reforms of the accountability of government.

One consequence of the National Audit Act 1983 is that the Comptroller and Auditor General (C ; AG) has adopted a new publishing policy.

The intention behind this policy is to reach a wider audience, with consequently greater publicity and public awareness of the investigations undertaken

The words' in connection with' have the widest connotation and I can not see how they are to be restricted in the absence of some context permitting such restriction. The strongest argument in favour of the taxpayers is the anomaly which would arise if the employer's business were running at a loss or was subsidised by endowment. As I have explained, in such a case the adoption of the literal meaning of the statutory words would lead to a result whereby the taxpayer is assessed at an amount greater than that <head>charged</head> by the employer to the public for the same service. The Crown have no answer to this anomaly as such. But there are other anomalies which arise if the taxpayer's argument is correct. For example if, unlike the present case, the school could have been filled with boys paying the full fee, the school would have lost the fee income from the places occupied by the children of the taxpayers for whom only the concessionary fee was payable.

definition: consumer price would extra used
example:
is that the consumer, in economically difficult times, is more likely to be attracted by the opportunity to save money than by incidental free offers or competitions. Price promotions are predominantly used by fast-moving consumer goods producers, especially in the grocery trade. Premium offers are marketing techniques which give extra value to goods or services in the short term as part of a promotional package. Under this category are the following. An offer of merchandise is communicated to the customer in, on or off the pack. The price <head>charged</head> to the customer covers the cost of the item to the promoter. The promoter is able to purchase such merchandise in bulk and thereby pass savings on to the customers who feel that they are getting good value for money. Such promotions are usually linked with the necessity to collect labels or cut out tokens, etc., from a number of purchases of the same, or same range of, products. Thus the premium need not necessarily be connected with the product that carried the premium; the idea is
