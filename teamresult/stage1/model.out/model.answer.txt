And' what did my daddy look like?' And' why did he go away and leave me?' All too many women like you are deserted even before their babies' birth. Some are forced into single-parenthood by a man who walks out on his wife or partner, often for a younger <head>model</head> and a quiet life away from nursery squalls. I daresay that as a result of your letter and my few words, I'll have an angry response from men who'll say,' what about the women who abandon their children for other men?' True, there are some of those, but there aren't droves of them.

In January this year the Home Office promised 350,000 to help set up an offender profiling unit which will record not only child murders but serial killings and rapes. It will emulate the FBI's behavioural science unit which describes its work as an odd mixture of detective work and psychology.

Cooling The ash cloud has been moving around the earth at 75 mph at an altitude of about 15 miles up in the stratosphere. Because there is little wind that high to split the particles up, it could stay there for years. So the cloud absorbs sunlight, heating the stratosphere up but stopping warmth from reaching the Earth. Now the NASA experts have recorded an average cooling of 0.2C already and their computer <head>model</head> predicts that will increase to 0.5C by the end of the year. And they claim that the knock-on effect is that weather patterns change. They point to statistics which show that six to 18 months after volcanic eruptions, eastern American states and most of North West Europe have lousy summers.

JOHN MCKENZIE: Donald Trump, it is said, is a man with more than a billion dollars to his name, a man who likes seeing his name on his airline, his office buildings, his casinos. Married to Ivana, a former <head>model</head>, Donald went looking for the limelight and found it. But what happens when after 12 years of marriage this public man walks out on his wife? Headline news. This story has taken New York by storm as the media here scrambled for any scrap of news or gossip about the couple's breakup.

they even wrote a sophomoric screenplay together about a perfect crime. It begins with the son murdering his wealthy parents. Nor did the Menendezes' troubles stop in Calabasas. Lyle was suspended from Princeton for cheating on a paper. Jose immediately flew back to try to get him reinstated. on camera So Lyle and Erik were not exactly <head>model</head> kids. Still, those kinds of family problems are hardly evidence of a desire or motive for murder.

"Let them also pick up the bums. " Although a few exiled felons were apprehended by U.S. immigration officials, most were not. " The conditions were too crowded, " says U.S. Army Col. Juan Armando Montes, who coordinated the reception. At the peak in early summer, he says, some 3,500 people were arriving every day. # As a result, within months of the boatlift's end in September, some Mariel refugees had committed murders, burglaries or hijackings. Yet many others became <head>model</head> citizens. Indeed, says Lisandro Perez, chairman of sociology and anthropology at Miami's Florida International University and himself a 1960 Cuban refugee, Mariels were driven less by politics than by economics: " They wanted to get ahead, make money and put their kids through college.

and general courses which by their nature and structure attract the unemployed. The MSC courses in 1985 included a Pre-Tops' Breakthrough' course, a Business Skills Workshop, New Skills courses, and Adult Preparation Training (funded through the Adult Training Strategy and using a modular approach). Unfortunately, many non-waged people are unable to benefit from these MSC courses since they are only available for those with UB40 cards. The courses are obviously based on a training <head>model</head>, and all colleges running such courses should evaluate longitudinally whether participants do in fact secure subsequent employment or further education and training. It is also important to evaluate other outcomes of these courses. Do they lead to increased self-confidence, and if so

All the same, however, it is at least tempting to think that' why?' here demands a switch of attention from rules to the intentions and motives of the agent. Weber makes the switch by applying a microeconomic <head>model</head> of rational action in order to understand action which is a calculated means to an end. Action occurs within a framework of shared meanings -- rules and collective values -- but is not dictated by that framework. In the style of economists, we are to reconstruct the agents' choices, given their preferences and information sets, assuming that they are rational agents.

definition: clear rather responsibilities between evidence
example:
The distribution of responsibilities between local, national, public and voluntary sectors has also become less rather than more clear, which reduces the possibilities of accountability. # Another interpretation of the changes would see them as part of a longer-term shift towards new relationships between government and the wider political economy. # Like Cockburn, Hoggett stresses the links between changes in the organization of local government and those of capitalist management. But the <head>model</head> he develops tends to distort the past in order to exaggerate the extent of change. It remains unclear why the changes he identifies have taken place and what the implications are. # There is some evidence that relationships between local government and business interests have become closer and more institutionalized, and this seems to support an interpretation which identifies a significant shift (or structural change) between the late 1960s and the late 1980s.

The latest scandal, this time involving the Prime Minister himself, Pierre Beregovoy, hitherto regarded as the very <head>model</head> of honesty and integrity, seemed like the last straw. M Beregovoy may claim that he has nothing to reproach himself with, but his acceptance of an interest-free million franc (125,000) loan from a shady businessman looks suspicious to say the least.

definition: nature political party dominance government
example:
the Conservatives would have had roughly 285 seats (and not 397), Labour 180 and the Alliance 160, resulting in a hung, three-party, parliament and a scramble to form a coalition. Two-party dominance was at its greatest in the period between 1945 and 1970 when the Conservative and Labour Parties won all but 8 per cent of the vote and 2 per cent of the seats. The <head>model</head> of responsible party government was born of this experience and it tended to elevate the politics of the moment into a law of nature that has distracted attention from the more fluid aspects of Britain's political experience.

WITHOUT going as far as opponents Ford, Vauxhall has said that airbags will be available as standard or as an option on most of its cars for 1994. Airbags are already standard on every Cavalier and Calibra, while half of the Astra range has one fitted. The same airbag system will be offered as an option from now on in new Corsas. Meanwhile, as part of the <head>model</head> year package of improvements, a new bhp 16-valve 1. litre engine becomes available for the Vauxhall Astra. On the Vauxhall Cavalier range, there's a new 1. litre economy engine, similar to the Corsa's Eco unit, which produces close to miles per gallon at a constant mph. Most of Vauxhall's changes come on the Cavalier and Calibra ranges.

So here is an attempt to try to answer some of those questions by direct substitution or with a small amount of modification.

Rover's policy of utilising parts which were already in production for a different <head>model</head> when building a new vehicle is particularly useful in places where spares are not as readily available.
