example:
When the adrenal glands are overworked due to chronic stress and lack of nutritional stores, they may not be able to supply your body with hormones such as cortisol, in the amounts needed to maintain homeostasis in your everyday life. For example, cortisol is supposed to rise in the morning, get you up and ready and hungry to eat a nice big breakfast, and then taper off once your belly is full. But your adrenals can&#8217;t produce cortisol or function normally without adequate potassium, magnesium, vitamin C, B vitamins, and other nutrients. You&#8217;ll get a nice big dose of those of them in a glass of fresh <head>orange</head> juice, though! If you really want to boost your OJ&#8217;s thyroid-and-adrenal-supporting superpowers, you&#8217;ll want to add a few shakes of sea salt to your cup. Salt down-regulates stress hormones and supports both of these glands immensely. But overall, OJ itself contains an impressive array of nutrients which work together synergistically to support hormone health.
